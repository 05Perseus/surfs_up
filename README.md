# Surfs Up Analysis

## *The Goal and Methodology*
### In this analysis we wanted to determine how sustainable our surf shop would be through each year. We did this by gathering and analyzing temperature data for the months of June and December.

## *What are the temperature statistics in June?*

1. June Temperature Statistics
    * Count = 1700
    * Mean = 75 Fahrenheit
    * Std = 3.26
    * Min Temp = 64 Fahrenheit
    * 25% = 73 Fahrenheit
    * 50% = 75 Fahrenheit
    * 75% = 77 Fahrenheit
    * Max Temp = 85 Fahrenheit

## *What are the temperature statistics in December?*

1. December Temperature Statistics
    * Count = 1517
    * Mean = 71 Fahrenheit
    * Std = 3.75
    * Min Temp = 56 Fahrenheit
    * 25% = 69 Fahrenheit
    * 50% = 71 Fahrenheit

## *Conclusion*
In conclusion, it seems like this surf shop will be open year round! While there is some variance at the low end of the temperatures, the average temperature and the maximum temperatures are very similar with only a 3 degree difference.

However, temperature isn't the only thing affected by seasonality. Additionally, the data counts gathered are pretty different. I would also suggest 2 other queries to help validate our business:

1. Precipitation levels in each month
2. Station readings activity levels

With these two extra queries we could get a better sense of how our business will perform at different times in the year.
